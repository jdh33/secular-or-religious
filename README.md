# secular-or-religious

The goal of this project is to determine if various texts are secular or religious in nature. The Gemini API will be leveraged to summarize sections of a text, when needed, and to create text embeddings to facilitate the investigation of semantic similarity, clustering, and classification.

The term "text" is being used because the writings being analyzed can vary greatly in type, structure, and purpose. Some texts that will be analyzed include:
 * The King James Bible, which can be thought of as a library of books. The books vary in length and style.
 * The Humanist Manifesto, which succinctly describes the philosophy and aspirations of humanism.
 * The Constitution of the United States of America, which is composed of the Preamble, seven articles, and 27 amendments.
 * The Quran, which is a collection of chapters that vary in length and style.
 * The Republic by Plato, which is a Socratic dialogue and is composed of several books.
